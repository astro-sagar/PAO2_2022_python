# PAO2_2022_python
This short python-astropy course is designed for 3rd-year bachelor's students in astronomy at the Astronomical Observatory of the Jagiellonian University [(OAUJ)](http://www.oa.uj.edu.pl/index.en.html) Krakow for Practical Observational Astronomy 2 [(POA 2)]() course. I assume some students are not familiar with python programming and the Jupyter-notebook console. At the same time, all students have some experience with any programming language. The course was designed by taking care of both perspectives. First, we will go through the basics of python. We will slowly move towards some necessary python packages like  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Astropy, which will be helpful in Astronomy.

## Files
This repository contains the following files
First file contains all the notebooks presented during the lab class. The second file contains all corresponding assignments related to module. The third file contains some essential installation instructions.
1. Jupyter-notebooks
* Introduction to python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* FITS handling with Astropy
2. Assignments
* Intro_assignment
* Numpy_assignment
* Matplotlib_assignment
* Astropy_assinment
3. Others
* Jupyter-notebook_installation.md
* mybinder_use.md

If you know how to use Jupyter-notebook directly, skip to [here](/assignments).
## Running Jupyter-notebooks
One can run each notebook online or on your machine.
1. Online method [refer here](/others/mybinder_use.md)
2. On your own machine [refer here](/others/Jupyter-notebook_installation.md)

N.B: Mybinder will take a few minutes. My binder may require a stable and a little bit faster internet connection. On my binder page, click the file button to see all listed notebooks there. 

Launch the mybinder link given in the end[as a logo] to access all practice notebooks (from class) and assignments. It will redirect to an online Jupyter-notebook console.

## Assignment submission:
Open the assignment notebook on online platform with mybinder  or download the notebook work in your own machine.
Send all the completed assignment notebooks in a zip/tar file named ```PAO2_yourname.zip``` to my email-id.
