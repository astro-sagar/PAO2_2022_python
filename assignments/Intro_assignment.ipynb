There are two types of radio telescopes in the world i.e. single-dish and interferometry radio telescopes. A single dish telescope is one antena while interferometer consists of array of antenna spread across an area. The distance between any two antenna in an interferometer is known as a baseline. Single dish telescope: Effelsberg radio telescope (D= 100m) and Green bank telescope (D=100m), Interferometry: GMRT (max baseline = 25 km) and VLA (max baseline = 36 km)\n",
