# PAO2_2022_astropy
This short python-astropy course is designed for 3rd year bachlor students in astronomy of Astronomical Observatory of the Jagiellonian University [(OAUJ)](http://www.oa.uj.edu.pl/index.en.html) Krakow for Practical Observational Astronomy 2 [(PAO2)]() course. I assume some students are not familiar with python programming and the Jupyter-notebook console. At the same time all have some experience with any type of programming language. The course is designed by taking care of both perspective. First we will go through the basics of python then we will slowly move towards some important python packages like  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Astropy.

## Running  Jupyter-notebooks
One can run each notebook on online platform or in your own machine
### Online method (using Mybinder)
Click on the mybinder link provided in the github page. It will redirect to a online Jupyter-notebook console.
To use mybinder follow the file *simple_mybinder_use.txt* file.

N.B : My binder will take some (few minutes). Mybinder may require a stable and little bit faster internet connection. In the mybinder page click the file button you can see all listed notebooks there. 

### On your own machine
You can directly run Jupyter-notebook on your machine. There are two ways to run Jupyter-notebooks  

* using pip
* using Anaconda distribution


Open Mybinder link given below [as a logo] to accsess all practice notebooks we go through in the class.
