# PAO2_2022_astropy
This short python-astropy course is designed for 3rd year bachlor students in astronomy of Astronomical Observatory of the Jagiellonian University [(OAUJ)](http://www.oa.uj.edu.pl/index.en.html) Krakow for Practical Observational Astronomy 2 [(POA 2)]() course. I assume some students are not familiar with python programming and the Jupyter-notebook console. At the same time all students have some experience with any type of programming language. The course was designed by taking care of both perspective. First we will go through the basics of python then we will slowly move towards some important python packages like  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Astropy which will be useful in the Astronomy.

* Matplotlib_assignment
* Astropy_assinment
3. Others
* Jupyter-notebook_installation.md
* mybinder_use.md

## Running Jupyter-notebooks
One can run each notebook in online platform or in your own machine.
1. Online method [refer here](/others/mybinder_use.md)
2. On your own machine [refer here](/others/Jupyter-notebook_installation.md)

N.B : My binder will take some (few minutes). Mybinder may require a stable and little bit faster internet connection. In the mybinder page click the file button you can see all listed notebooks there. 

Launch the mybinder link given in the end[as a logo] to accsess all practice notebooks (from class) and assignments.It will redirect to a online Jupyter-notebook console.
## Assignment submission
