## Usage
1. Go to ```File Browser```; you can browse all available directories and subdirectories on the GitHub page. Access your lecture notebooks and assignments.
2. To open any notebook ```double click``` on the notebook in the directory section.
3. Run the notebook cell by cell (or line by line) by clicking ```SHIFT+Enter``` .
4. There are two modes for the cell
* ```Markdown``` mode (to write some description, which will not be considared as code)
* ```Code``` mode (to write code)
6. Use ```Esc+B``` or click ```+``` button in the taskbar to insert a new cell in the Jupyter-notebook.
7. Use ```CTRL+S``` to save the notebook.
8. Use the ```Download``` button in the taskbar, which is located on top of each notebook, to save your current changes. You can send assignments after downloading the current state of the notebook.
9. After using mybinder, goto ```Files``` click on ```Shut down```. Otherwise, it will create a problem for your colleagues.

N.B: My binder will take a few minutes. Mybinder may require a stable and little bit faster internet connection. On the mybinder page, click the file button. You can see all listed notebooks there.
